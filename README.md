## Projects
### Exploratory data analysis with various python libraries

In this experiment the relation between habits, circumsatnces, and marks of high school students were studied using the essential steps of the data science workflow. An exploratory analysis proved that study time, going out, internet access, and free time were related to grades. Which was agianist the hypothesis, which stated alcohol, romantic relationship, family support, and extra paid classes would have a relationship. the results showed that studnets who had a lot of free time and no internet access failed the least and students who had low free time and access to internet failed the most. Additionally, students who studied more and went out less failed less and students who studied less and went out often failed more. These outcomes suggest that the biggest distactions for studenst are the internet and going out with freinds. And freeing up time for studying will yield better results.
